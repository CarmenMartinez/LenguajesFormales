	<title>Neil Bartlett: Bndtools and Maven: A Brave New World</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://njbartlett.github.com/2017/09/13/bndtools-and-maven</guid>
	<link>http://njbartlett.name/2017/09/13/bndtools-and-maven.html</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;At this year’s OSGi Community Event – co-hosted with EclipseCon Europe 2017 – I will present a new tutorial titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/session/bndtools-and-maven-brave-new-world&quot;&gt;Bndtools and Maven: A Brave New World&lt;/a&gt;. My friend and &lt;a href=&quot;https://paremus.com&quot;&gt;Paremus&lt;/a&gt; colleague &lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.paremus.com/author/tim-ward/&quot;&gt;Tim Ward&lt;/a&gt; will co-present and will provide support during the exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bndtools has long provided the premier development experience for writing OSGi bundles and applications. However there was a significant gap: until recently it has been very difficult to use Maven to build Bndtools projects. This was partially because of legacy issues (after starting with ANT as our standard build tool, we eventually migrated to Gradle). Partially it was because Maven is far more prescriptive in terms of the structure and lifecycle of a project, and it took a long time to find a way to fit our models together. These problems meant that Bndtools was simply unusable for a large number of developers, in particular those working for organisations that have standardised on Maven – and also of course those developers who simply prefer Maven!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These problems are now essentially solved and, from Bndtools version 3.4, Maven is a fully supported build environment.&lt;/strong&gt; Gradle also remains fully supported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, we will walk through all of the day-to-day development tasks in the new Bndtools/Maven toolchain. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Starting a new project from scratch;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adding bundle modules to the project;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Managing library dependencies;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integration testing (i.e. in-container testing);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Running bundles and tests from the IDE, and the rapid code/run cycle enabled by Bndtools;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Indexing, resolving and assembling applications for deployment;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Managing bundle and package versions;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Configuring a Continuous Integration build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following Maven plugins will be covered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bnd-maven-plugin&lt;/code&gt;: the core plugin that generates OSGi bundle JARs;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bnd-testing-maven-plugin&lt;/code&gt;: executes OSGi in-container tests;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bnd-indexer-maven-plugin&lt;/code&gt;: indexes OSGi bundles and dependencies for assembly and/or runtime resolving;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bnd-export-maven-plugin&lt;/code&gt;: assembles a standalone OSGi application from its minimal bundles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do hope that you will attend this tutorial armed with lots of questions! Prerequisites are Bndtools 3.5 (which will have been released before the conference), JDK 8 and Maven 3. Also make sure you sign up to attend the tutorial on the EclipseCon website, and of course you also need a ticket to the main conference.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.oracle.com/theaquarium/opening-up-ee-update&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Oracle announced today&lt;/a&gt; that they, along with IBM and &lt;a href=&quot;http://middlewareblog.redhat.com/2017/09/12/java-ee-moves-to-eclipse/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;, will be moving Java EE to the Eclipse Foundation. I would like to welcome everyone involved to our community. We look forward to working with all of the participants in the Java EE ecosystem as it moves to a more open and collaborative development model. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Java EE has been at the center of enterprise computing for almost twenty years. As enterprises move to a more cloud-centric model, it is clear that Java EE requires a more rapid pace of innovation. The open source model has been shown time and again to be the most successful way to innovate in today’s world. The Eclipse Foundation is focused on enabling open collaboration among individuals, small companies, enterprises, and the largest vendors. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://microprofile.io/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eclipse MicroProfile&lt;/a&gt; project is, we believe, an excellent example of the developer community led style of collaboration we support. We look forward to supporting the Java EE community as it creates the platform for the next twenty years of business applications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filed under: &lt;a href=&quot;https://mmilinkov.wordpress.com/category/foundation/&quot;&gt;Foundation&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/mmilinkov.wordpress.com/1337/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/mmilinkov.wordpress.com/1337/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=mmilinkov.wordpress.com&amp;amp;blog=19461799&amp;amp;post=1337&amp;amp;subd=mmilinkov&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Chris Aniszczyk: Launching TODO Group Guides</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://aniszczyk.org/?p=4145</guid>
	<link>http://aniszczyk.org/2017/09/11/launching-todo-group-guides/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In my participation with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://todogroup.org&quot;&gt;TODO Group&lt;/a&gt;, we recently published a set of open source guides (under CC-BY-SA 4.0) dedicated to help companies build out open source programs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;we're happy to open source a set of living guides to help you get started with open source program management! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/uWZ2BG3LL7&quot;&gt;https://t.co/uWZ2BG3LL7&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/iFTwgJ0oqT&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/iFTwgJ0oqT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— TODO Group (@todogroup) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/todogroup/status/907256620652019712&quot;&gt;September 11, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last year or so, we have seen companies like AWS &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2016/12/01/amazon-open-source-guru/&quot;&gt;build out an open source program&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AWSOpen&quot;&gt;@AWSOpen&lt;/a&gt; and even companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenewstack.io/makers-dirk-hohndel-vmware-role-open-source-commercial-software/&quot;&gt;VMWare hired their first Chief Open Source Officer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve had many organizations approach TODO Group members asking for advice on how to get started with an open source program and these guides are a reaction to that. It is our hope that these are &lt;strong&gt;living guides&lt;/strong&gt; and evolve with community input over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We’ve entered the quiet period for Eclipse Collections development while we wait for the official release notice from the Eclipse Foundation. This will be our second major release since the &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.collections&quot;&gt;Eclipse Collections project&lt;/a&gt; started at the Eclipse Foundation. These are exciting times. Draft release notes &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTE_DRAFT.md&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have an official logo, expect stickers and t-shirts soon. Preference will go first to Eclipse Collections committers and contributors, but anyone can become a contributor. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;contribution guide&lt;/a&gt; for details on how to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Java 9 and Eclipse Collections 9.0 will both be well covered at JavaOne in San Francisco this year. I will be giving a talk this year on the API design of Eclipse Collections. I’m looking forward to the opportunity to explain how and why Eclipse Collections became all that it is today. Drop by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://events.rainfocus.com/catalog/oracle/oow17/catalogjavaone17?search=CON6133&amp;amp;showEnrolled=false&quot;&gt;API Deep Dive: Designing Eclipse Collections [CON6133]&lt;/a&gt; if you are at JavaOne this year and want to learn about the design and evolution of an advanced Java Collections framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too many Java Collections frameworks, not enough time to learn them all? Drop by our &lt;a href=&quot;https://events.rainfocus.com/catalog/oracle/oow17/catalogjavaone17?search=CON1754&amp;amp;showEnrolled=false&quot;&gt;Collections.compare:JDK, Eclipse, Guava, Apache… [CON1754]&lt;/a&gt; talk. The talk will cover APIs available in Java 8 Streams and the latest versions of Apache Commons Collections, Guava, Eclipse Collections and Vavr. This talk will help you make the most out of one of your precious few hours at JavaOne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;New to Eclipse Collections?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want an overview of the framework, then check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections/blob/master/docs/guide.md&quot;&gt;reference guide&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to really learn Eclipse Collections (we learn best by doing), the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections-kata&quot;&gt;Eclipse Collections kata&lt;/a&gt; is a great way to get started. I have updated the Eclipse Collections Kata recently with more hints and pointers. The web-based slides that guide the kata are &lt;a href=&quot;http://eclipse.github.io/eclipse-collections-kata&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Want to know more?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can now follow Eclipse Collections news and related topics on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EclipseCollect&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out the code and follow the project on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; if you want to keep up to date live with where things are heading and with the contributions that the community is making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch Kristen O’Leary’s recent talk at QCon New York on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.infoq.com/presentations/java-eclipse-collections?utm_source=presentations_about_java&amp;amp;utm_medium=link&amp;amp;utm_campaign=java&quot;&gt;Java Evolution of Eclipse Collections&lt;/a&gt;.

	<title>Stephan Herrmann: Jigsaw arriving – and now what?</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://objectteams.wordpress.com/?p=599</guid>
	<link>https://objectteams.wordpress.com/2017/09/10/jigsaw-arriving-and-now-what/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;The debate is over. The result of fierce discussions has been declared. &lt;a href=&quot;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk9/spec/&quot;&gt;Jigsaw is knocking at the door&lt;/a&gt;. Now the fate of Jigsaw depends on the community. Will the community embrace Jigsaw? Will we be able to leverage the new concepts to our benefit? Will we struggle with new pitfalls?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s step back a second: do we really know &lt;em&gt;what is Jigsaw&lt;/em&gt;? Do we really understand the design, its subtleties and implications?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;eclipsecon2017&quot; class=&quot; size-full wp-image-604 alignleft&quot; src=&quot;https://objectteams.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/eclipsecon2017.png?w=700&quot; style=&quot;border: 0;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017&quot;&gt;EclipseCon Europe 2017&lt;/a&gt; I will try to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/session/jdt-embraces-java%E2%84%A2-9-insiders-view&quot;&gt;shed a light&lt;/a&gt; on some lesser known aspects of Jigsaw. A deep dive into things I learned as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?action=wrap&amp;amp;assigned_to_realname=Stephan%20Herrmann&amp;amp;classification=Eclipse&amp;amp;component=Core&amp;amp;component=UI&amp;amp;j_top=OR&amp;amp;list_id=16733655&amp;amp;product=JDT&amp;amp;resolution=FIXED&amp;amp;saved_report_id=82&amp;amp;target_milestone=BETA%20J9&quot;&gt;JDT committer&lt;/a&gt; while implementing tool support for Java 9.&lt;br style=&quot;clear: both;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In search for truth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set the stage, we’ll first have to figure out, who or what defines Java 9 — or Jigsaw — or JPMS. This is both a question of specification vs. implementation as well as a matter of a specification spread over several documents and artifacts. Let’s try to grok Jigsaw from the legally binding sources, rather then from secondary writing and hearsay (&lt;em&gt;if that is possible&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will have to relearn some of the basic terms, like: what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a package in Java? Do packages form a hierarchy? &lt;em&gt;(I will show, how both answers, yes and no, are equally right and wrong).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jigsaw is said to do away with some “undesirable” stuff like split packages, and cyclic dependencies. Really? &lt;em&gt;(Yes and no).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Encapsulation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, with Jigsaw all is about encapsulation – easy to agree on, but what is it that a Java 9 module encapsulates? Only a deep understanding of the flavor of encapsulation will tell us, what exact qualities we gain from following the new discipline (&lt;em&gt;it’s not about security, e.g.&lt;/em&gt;), and also what pains will be incurred on the path of migrating to the new model. (&lt;em&gt;Hint: I will be speaking both about compile time and runtime&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the magic potion Jigsaw also brings its own antidote: With tightening the rules of encapsulation, also the opposite becomes necessary: they call it breaking encapsulation, for which I once coined the term “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.objectteams.org/publications/index.html#SPLAT08&quot; title=&quot;“... technology should support the co-existence of encapsulation and its inverse — decapsulation — within a single system.”[Herrmann2008]&quot;&gt;decapsulation&lt;/a&gt;“. I should be flattered by how close Java 9 comes to what I call “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2008_12/article3.pdf&quot;&gt;gradual encapsulation&lt;/a&gt;“. So, the talk can not stop at presenting just the new language concepts, also the various extra-lingual means for tuning your architecture need to be inspected through the looking glass. This is also where tools come into focus: how can JDT empower its users to use the new options without the need to dig through the sometimes cryptic syntax of command line parameters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Loose ends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point we shall agree that Jigsaw is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/spec/issues/&quot;&gt;compromise&lt;/a&gt;, fulfilling many of its goals and promises, while also missing some opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also have to say a few words about long standing API of JDT, which makes guarantees that are no longer valid in Java 9. This raises the question: what is the migration path for tools that sit on top of JDT? (&lt;em&gt;There is no free lunch&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it wouldn’t be Java, if &lt;a href=&quot;https://gbracha.blogspot.de/2009/09/systemic-overload.html&quot;&gt;overloading&lt;/a&gt; wouldn’t make things worse for the newly added concepts. But: haven’t you become fond of hating, when JDT says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;padding: 1pt; background-color: #404040;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; font-size: 7pt; font-family: monospace; background-color: #ffffde;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;error_obj&quot; class=&quot;size-full wp-image-160&quot; src=&quot;https://objectteams.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/error_obj.gif?w=700&quot; style=&quot;vertical-align: middle; border: 0;&quot; /&gt; The type org.foo.Bar cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may be seeing light at the end of the tunnel: for Jigsaw we had to revamp the guts of our compiler in ways, that could possibly help to – finally – resolve that problem. Wish me luck …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope to see you in Ludwigsburg, there’s much to be discussed over coffee and beer&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Mike Milinkovich: Java: Free At Last</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://mmilinkov.wordpress.com/?p=1265</guid>
	<link>https://mmilinkov.wordpress.com/2017/09/07/java-free-at-last/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;There was lots of news in the land of Java yesterday. If you have not already seen the posts by Mark Reinhold and Donald Smith of Oracle, I encourage you to read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mreinhold.org/blog/forward-faster&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Moving Java Forward Faster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/discuss/2017-September/004281.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Accelerating the JDK release cadence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/faster-and-easier-use-and-redistribution-of-java-se&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Faster and Easier Use and Redistribution of Java SE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been an enormous number of articles written about this news, most of which have focused on the new time-based release cadence. Obviously coming from an Eclipse background, I’m a big believer in the idea of release trains. After all, Eclipse Foundation projects have been doing this for over a decade. I believe that this is going to be a good thing for the Java platform, once the teams inside Oracle get into the groove of producing time boxed releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But relatively little has been written about what I think is the really big news:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;“…Oracle plans to ship OpenJDK builds under the GPL…” and “…within a few releases there should be no technical differences between OpenJDK builds and Oracle JDK binaries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which means that Java will finally be freed of the explicit and implicit field of use restrictions which have dogged it since its invention. Developers will be free to use Java on any device, without requiring any additional licensing or other permission. I believe that this is going to lead to a resurgence of innovation in the Java ecosystem. And I am particularly optimistic about what this could mean for Java as the language of choice for many solutions in the Internet of Things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The license that Java binaries are currently distributed under today is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/license/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Oracle Binary Code License&lt;/a&gt;, which states (emphasis added):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;“General Purpose Desktop Computers and Servers” means computers, including desktop and laptop computers, or servers, used for general computing functions under end user control (such as but not specifically limited to email, general purpose Internet browsing, and office suite productivity tools). The use of Software in systems and solutions that provide dedicated functionality (other than as mentioned above) or designed for use in embedded or function-specific software applications, for example but not limited to: &lt;strong&gt;Software embedded in or bundled with industrial control systems, wireless mobile telephones, wireless handheld devices, kiosks, TV/STB, Blu-ray Disc devices, telematics and network control switching equipment, printers and storage management systems, and other related systems are excluded from this definition and not licensed under this Agreement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making Java binaries available directly from OpenJDK is going to free the Java platform for developers. Getting these directly from the platform owner, and (more importantly) having them be identical to the commercial binaries is a radical step forward. OpenJDK-based binaries will be exactly on par with, and equivalent to, the commercial ones. Although almost all of the Java &lt;em&gt;source code&lt;/em&gt; has been open source at OpenJDK for many years, the subtle differences in content, performance, and reliability have prevented mainstream adoption of OpenJDK &lt;em&gt;binaries&lt;/em&gt; by enterprises and industrials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little over a decade ago, Sun Microsystems started the process of open sourcing Java. It seems that Oracle is finally finishing the job. Good for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filed under: &lt;a href=&quot;https://mmilinkov.wordpress.com/category/foundation/&quot;&gt;Foundation&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/mmilinkov.wordpress.com/1265/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/mmilinkov.wordpress.com/1265/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=mmilinkov.wordpress.com&amp;amp;blog=19461799&amp;amp;post=1265&amp;amp;subd=mmilinkov&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>Paolo Patierno: EnMasse and Eclipse Hono ? Messaging and IoT ? I have some events for you !</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://paolopatierno.wordpress.com/?p=5364</guid>
	<link>https://paolopatierno.wordpress.com/2017/09/06/enmasse-and-eclipse-hono-messaging-and-iot-i-have-some-events-for-you/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;events&quot; class=&quot; size-full wp-image-5420 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://paolopatierno.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/events.png?w=620&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Do you want to learn more about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://enmasse.io/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;EnMasse&lt;/a&gt; project ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Do you want to learn the same for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/hono/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eclipse Hono &lt;/a&gt;project ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Do you want to know more about their relationship and how they simplify the development and deployment of messaging and IoT solutions ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Well … in the coming weeks my agenda will be packed of events about them. Let’s see !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Eclipse Day Milan 2017&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;September 22nd&lt;/strong&gt; there will be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://eclipsedaymilano.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eclipse Day Milan 2017&lt;/a&gt; and I’ll be there with the &lt;strong&gt;“Eclipse Hono : Connect. Command. Control.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://eclipsedaymilano.com/2017/06/30/eclipse-hono-connect-command-control/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;session&lt;/a&gt;. What will you see there ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The open source counterpart to closed and proprietary IoT solutions is called Hono ! Born out of the collaboration of big companies, including Red Hat and Bosch both members of the Eclipse Foundation, Hono is an open source framework which aims to add features, such as device management and authentication, on top of an highly scalable messaging infrastructure in order to guarantee secured data exchange between devices and cloud applications. Using its APIs, devices can send data (telemetry and event) and can be controlled remotely (command/control). During this session we will see the “bricks” that make its architecture, the exposed APIs and the integration with other solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;There will be a lot of other great sessions focused on the Eclipse Foundation ecosystem so I think that it will be a really awesome event !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Eclipse IoT Virtual meetup&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;The Eclipse Foundation hosts a lot of virtual meetups on IoT projects which are part of the foundation itself. Of course, Eclipse Hono is one of them !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;October 11st&lt;/strong&gt;, I and Kai Hudalla (from Bosch Software Innovations) will have this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/Virtual-IoT/events/242190258/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;meetup&lt;/a&gt;. We hope to reach a really huge “online” audience in order to show how Hono is a really powerful platform for connecting and control IoT devices at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be simpler for you to be there … just take a seat at home !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;JavaSI&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;October 16th – 17th&lt;/strong&gt; there will be the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sioug.si/index.php/javasi-2017/program/vsebine-javasi&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JavaSI&lt;/a&gt; conference organized by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sioug.si/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SIOUG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;I and my awesome team mate &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lulf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ulf Lilleengen&lt;/a&gt; will be there with a session and a workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;First of all the&lt;strong&gt; “EnMasse : open sourcing the messaging and IoT” &lt;/strong&gt;session as an introduction to the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Out there there are a lot of “closed” source products for developing messaging and IoT based solutions. What if you want to have more control on your platform ? EnMasse is the answer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;It’s a totally “open” source messaging-as-a-service platform which can be deployed on-premise, in the cloud or even in an hybrid scenario. At the same time it aims to be highly scalable in terms of throughput and the number of connections, based on standard protocols like AMQP 1.0 and MQTT and provides different patterns for messages exchange. Its nature makes EnMasse a great solution for IoT deployments in order to handle millions of connected devices for ingesting telemetry data and controlling them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Then the &lt;strong&gt;“EnMasse – messaging and IoT in your hands”&lt;/strong&gt; workshop speaking about the EnMasse project and how it’s really great for building messaging and IoT solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Interested in messaging and IoT ? Kubernetes and OpenShift? In this workshop, we will dive into EnMasse, an open source Messaging-as-a-Service platform, built on top of Kubernetes and OpenShift. You will setup OpenShift or Kubernetes, deploy EnMasse, and build an end-2-end solution with edge devices, messaging, and analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;You will learn basic Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts as we go, and learn how you can use EnMasse to implement different messaging patterns in your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this workshop you will touch messaging and IoT stuff with your hands !&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/paolopatierno.wordpress.com/5364/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/paolopatierno.wordpress.com/5364/&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=paolopatierno.wordpress.com&amp;amp;blog=15467422&amp;amp;post=5364&amp;amp;subd=paolopatierno&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;With our background of being consultants for several years, having seen a lot of projects, some years ago we started collecting what is called &quot;bloomers&quot; in literature. Those were the kind of programming misconceptions that made us laugh and cry at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Maximilian and Jonas: Mountain Office for one week: Our OpenSource Week August 2017</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://eclipsesource.com/?p=35424</guid>
	<link>https://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2017/09/06/mountain-office-for-one-week-our-opensource-week-august-2017/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;At EclipseSource, we are continuously developing open source software as committers and contributors for projects at Eclipse.org (e.g. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://emfforms.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;EMF Forms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;) or on GitHub (e.g. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jsonforms.io&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;JSON Forms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;). In fact, contributing to open source projects and in turn making them ready for professional use is our core business. Therefore, much of the work completed in these projects is driven by our customers requirements and provides direct value in adopters projects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Once a year, however, we fully retreat for one week from any customer work. All subsidiaries meet at an offsite location to fully focus on topics related to open source projects. This week is appropriately called “Open Source Week”. It allows us to drive innovation, invent new technology and place the seed for future open source frameworks. Last but not least, for a globally distributed company like us, it is also a great social event for all employees.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Like last year, our open source week once again took place in the mountains, this time in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt; Schönau/Berchtesgaden. The pictures below gives you an impression about this great event, a mixture of work and obviously also a lot of fun. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-35435 &quot; height=&quot;680&quot; src=&quot;https://eclipsesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Copy-of-Photo-Collage-–-Untitled-Design.jpg&quot; width=&quot;850&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;The weather was hot and sunny almost all week. The view from the hotel terrace wasn’t too bad &lt;img alt=&quot;😉&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; src=&quot;https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.2.1/72x72/1f609.png&quot; style=&quot;height: 1em;&quot; /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-35430 &quot; height=&quot;634&quot; src=&quot;https://eclipsesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/image-20170801_084444-EFFECTS-1024x768.jpg&quot; width=&quot;845&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;On these very hot days we made short trips in the surroundings: A walk to the beautiful Königsee including a refreshing jump into the lake on Tuesday afternoon, and a little hike to the Hugo-Beck-House with a great view above the Berchtesgadner mountains on Wednesday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-35437 &quot; height=&quot;637&quot; src=&quot;https://eclipsesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Untitled-design-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;796&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day was a bit different – this was our Tuesday. We usually did excursions in the afternoon and worked in the evening to take advantage of the sunny weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-35429 &quot; height=&quot;437&quot; src=&quot;https://eclipsesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/IMG_20170804_152456-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;328&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Wednesday night we also had a special company dinner outside at the lake …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-35435 size-full&quot; height=&quot;756&quot; src=&quot;https://eclipsesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Copy-of-Photo-Collage-–-Untitled-Design.jpg&quot; width=&quot;945&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Besides Open Source topics, we also train our employees in other important topics, e.g. a short intro into first aid by our first aid helper and employee Eugen. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;On the last day, each team presented its results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Then it was time to say goodbye and everybody made their way back home to Vienna, Munich and Paris!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interested in Angular? Maximilian Koegel and Edgar Mueller tell us more about their   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/session/what-every-eclipse-developer-should-know-about-angular&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many business applications nowadays have at least some web UI parts using server-side rendered, static HTML. With the latest dynamic HTML Javascript frameworks like React, Vue.js, or Ember.js, there is a continuous trend to implement these web front-ends as “single page” applications. While there is a lot of diversity in the JavaScript world, one framework that has become especially popular for business applications, is Angular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-news-image field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/news/tutorial-what-every-eclipse-developer-should-know-about-angular&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive block-center&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; src=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/sites/default/files/styles/solstice_news_-_default_-_thumbnail/public/news/AngularExample.png?itok=JGHAp9Gc&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

	<title>Donald Raab: As a matter of Factory — Part 2 (Immutable)</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">https://medium.com/p/8cb72ff897ee</guid>
	<link>https://medium.com/@donraab/as-a-matter-of-factory-part-2-immutable-8cb72ff897ee?source=rss-df39b86e9f04------2</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@donraab/as-a-matter-of-factory-part-1-mutable-75cc2c5d72d9&quot;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt; of this blog series on Collection Factories, I illustrated how the factory classes in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/collections/&quot;&gt;Eclipse Collections&lt;/a&gt; can be used to create instances of mutable collections. In part 2, I will show how the same factory classes can be used to create immutable collections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to create immutable collections in Eclipse Collections, you would use &amp;lt;FactoryClass&amp;gt;.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(x, y, z).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ImmutableList&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; list = &lt;br /&gt;    Lists.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ImmutableSet&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; set = &lt;br /&gt;    Sets.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ImmutableBag&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; bag = &lt;br /&gt;    Bags.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ImmutableMap&amp;lt;Integer, String&amp;gt; map = &lt;br /&gt;    Maps.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(1, &quot;1&quot;, 2, &quot;2&quot;, 3, &quot;3&quot;);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’d like a more concise option for creating immutable containers, you can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/collections/javadoc/8.2.0/org/eclipse/collections/impl/factory/Iterables.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iterables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; class in Eclipse Collections with static imports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ImmutableList&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; list = &lt;br /&gt;    &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;iList&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ImmutableSet&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; set = &lt;br /&gt;    &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;iSet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ImmutableBag&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; bag = &lt;br /&gt;    &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;iBag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ImmutableMap&amp;lt;Integer, String&amp;gt; map = &lt;br /&gt;    &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;iMap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;(1, &quot;1&quot;, 2, &quot;2&quot;, 3, &quot;3&quot;);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;“i”&lt;/strong&gt; methods are short for “&lt;strong&gt;immutable&lt;/strong&gt;”, and the &lt;strong&gt;“m”&lt;/strong&gt; methods are short for “&lt;strong&gt;mutable&lt;/strong&gt;”. As mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@donraab/as-a-matter-of-factory-part-1-mutable-75cc2c5d72d9&quot;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;, there is currently no equivalent of the Iterables class for the primitive factories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want empty immutable collections, use the empty method on the immutable factory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ImmutableList&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; list = &lt;br /&gt;    Lists.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.empty();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ImmutableSet&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; set = &lt;br /&gt;    Sets.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.empty();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ImmutableBag&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; bag = &lt;br /&gt;    Bags.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.empty();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ImmutableMap&amp;lt;Integer, String&amp;gt; map = &lt;br /&gt;    Maps.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.empty();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;An empty immutable collection is a singleton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;ImmutableCollection does not extend Collection&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is important distinction between the &lt;strong&gt;MutableCollection&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;ImmutableCollection&lt;/strong&gt; hierarchies in Eclipse Collections. The interfaces that extend &lt;strong&gt;ImmutableCollection&lt;/strong&gt; do not extend &lt;strong&gt;java.util &lt;/strong&gt;equivalents as their mutable counterparts do. This design decision was explained in detail in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29504881/immutablelist-does-not-extend-list&quot;&gt;StackOverflow post&lt;/a&gt;. While an &lt;strong&gt;ImmutableList&lt;/strong&gt; does not extend &lt;strong&gt;java.util.List&lt;/strong&gt;, every implementation of &lt;strong&gt;ImmutableList&lt;/strong&gt; must extend &lt;strong&gt;java.util.List&lt;/strong&gt; as depicted in the following diagram. The &lt;strong&gt;ImmutableCollection&lt;/strong&gt; implementations will not have any mutating methods like add, remove, addAll, removeAll or clear, and the Iterator returned for any of these types will not support remove. The implementations must extend &lt;strong&gt;java.util.List&lt;/strong&gt; however to support the equals and hashcode contracts of a List.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/946/1*kteEV7063kfS91tJrLBvzA.png&quot; /&gt;ImmutableList does not extend java.util.List&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;You cannot create the &lt;strong&gt;ImmutableList&lt;/strong&gt; implementations directly, but instead must use the appropriate factory class. The factory classes do not return the implementation class type, but instead return the interface type, such as &lt;strong&gt;ImmutableList&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;ImmutableSet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The factory classes may return an optimized container for smaller collection sizes. For instance, for &lt;strong&gt;ImmutableList&lt;/strong&gt;, there are optimized implementations for empty, singleton, doubleton, tripleton and all the way to decapleton. None of these implementations require a backing array, but instead as the diagram depicts, keep direct references to their elements. For sets and maps, the optimization goes to quadrupleton (4). For Bags, there is a special optimization called &lt;strong&gt;ImmutableArrayBag&lt;/strong&gt;, which will go as high as 20 elements, and then will use an &lt;strong&gt;ImmutableHashBag&lt;/strong&gt; for larger collections. The following should give an indication of the potential memory savings obtained by using small immutable collections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Memory Cost in Bytes&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Type - Size: Mutable — Immutable&lt;br /&gt;— — — — — — — — — — - - - - - - -&lt;br /&gt;List — 0: 40 – 16&lt;br /&gt;List — 1: 48 – 16&lt;br /&gt;List — 2: 48 – 24&lt;br /&gt;List — 3: 56 – 24&lt;br /&gt;List — 4: 56 – 32&lt;br /&gt;List — 5: 64 – 32&lt;br /&gt;List — 6: 64 – 40&lt;br /&gt;List — 7: 72 – 40&lt;br /&gt;List — 8: 72 – 48&lt;br /&gt;List — 9: 80 – 48&lt;br /&gt;List -10: 80 – 56&lt;br /&gt;List -11: 88 – 80&lt;br /&gt;— — — — — — — — — — &lt;br /&gt;Bag — 0 : 216 – 16&lt;br /&gt;Bag — 1 : 232 – 32&lt;br /&gt;Bag — 2 : 248 – 104&lt;br /&gt;Bag — 3 : 264 – 136&lt;br /&gt;Bag — 4 : 280 – 152&lt;br /&gt;Bag — 5 : 296 – 184&lt;br /&gt;— — — — — — — — — — &lt;br /&gt;Set — 0 : 112 – 16&lt;br /&gt;Set — 1 : 72  – 32&lt;br /&gt;Set — 2 : 96  – 56&lt;br /&gt;Set — 3 : 112 – 72&lt;br /&gt;Set — 4 : 208 – 96&lt;br /&gt;Set — 5 : 224 – 176&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used ObjectSizeCalculator.&lt;em&gt;getObjectSize()&lt;/em&gt; to calculate the memory cost for each object. For List, I used &lt;em&gt;null&lt;/em&gt; for the elements, to reduce the memory cost down to the data structure only. For Bag and Set I used &lt;em&gt;new Object()&lt;/em&gt; for elements to have the smallest possible object footprint. The potential memory savings would be greater as well, if your mutable collections are not trimmed to size. I have worked in an application previously where I had millions of small sets, lists and maps. The memory savings that was achieved using these small immutable collections was substantial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interop with the JDK collection types&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can technically cast an &lt;strong&gt;ImmutableList&lt;/strong&gt; to a &lt;strong&gt;java.util.List&lt;/strong&gt;, but this would be an ugly and unsafe way of providing interop with existing libraries. Instead, there are methods available on each immutable interface that can cast the type to the appropriate JDK type for you. The following shows how you can use these methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; list = &lt;br /&gt;    Lists.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;).&lt;strong&gt;castToList&lt;/strong&gt;();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Set&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; set = &lt;br /&gt;    Sets.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;).&lt;strong&gt;castToSet&lt;/strong&gt;();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Map&amp;lt;Integer, String&amp;gt; map = &lt;br /&gt;    Maps.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(1, &quot;1&quot;, 2, &quot;2&quot;, 3, &quot;3&quot;).&lt;strong&gt;castToMap&lt;/strong&gt;();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has always been a core design principle in Eclipse Collections to provide good interop with the existing JDK collection types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: &lt;/strong&gt;There is no &lt;strong&gt;castToBag&lt;/strong&gt; method on &lt;strong&gt;ImmutableBag&lt;/strong&gt;, because there is no &lt;strong&gt;Bag&lt;/strong&gt; type in the JDK today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mutable Builders for Immutable Collections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is another very useful factory approach for creating immutable collections. In Eclipse Collections, every mutable type has a method which can copy itself to its immutable equivalent type. The method name is &lt;strong&gt;toImmutable&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ImmutableList&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; list = &lt;br /&gt;    Lists.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;).&lt;strong&gt;toImmutable&lt;/strong&gt;();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ImmutableSet&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; set = &lt;br /&gt;    Sets.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;).&lt;strong&gt;toImmutable&lt;/strong&gt;();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ImmutableBag&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; bag = &lt;br /&gt;    Bags.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;).&lt;strong&gt;toImmutable&lt;/strong&gt;();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ImmutableMap&amp;lt;Integer, String&amp;gt; map = &lt;br /&gt;    Maps.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(1, &quot;1&quot;, 2, &quot;2&quot;, 3, &quot;3&quot;).&lt;strong&gt;toImmutable&lt;/strong&gt;();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that every mutable collection is a natural &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;builder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for its corresponding immutable type. We do not provide immutable builders to convert to any different types however. So if you wanted an &lt;strong&gt;ImmutableSet&lt;/strong&gt; built from a &lt;strong&gt;MutableList&lt;/strong&gt;, you would have to use one of the two approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ImmutableSet&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; set1 = &lt;br /&gt;    Lists.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;).&lt;strong&gt;toSet&lt;/strong&gt;().&lt;strong&gt;toImmutable&lt;/strong&gt;();&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableSet&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; set2 = &lt;br /&gt;    Sets.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.withAll(Lists.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;));&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Object and Primitive Immutable Collections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are examples of all the object collection types you can create using the immutable factories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ImmutableList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; list = Lists.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.empty();&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableSet&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; set = Sets.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.empty();&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableSortedSet&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; sortedSet = SortedSets.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.empty();&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableMap&amp;lt;K, V&amp;gt; map = Maps.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.empty();&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableSortedMap&amp;lt;K, V&amp;gt; sortedMap = SortedMaps.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.empty();&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableStack&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; stack = Stacks.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.empty();&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableBag&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; bag = Bags.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.empty();&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableSortedBag&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; sortedBag = SortedBags.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.empty();&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableBiMap&amp;lt;K, V&amp;gt; biMap = BiMaps.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.empty();&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableListMultimap&amp;lt;K, V&amp;gt; mm = Multimaps.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.list.empty();&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableSetMultimap&amp;lt;K, V&amp;gt; mm = Multimaps.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.set.empty();&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableBagMultimap&amp;lt;K, V&amp;gt; mm = Multimaps.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.bag.empty();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eclipse Collections supports immutable containers for all eight of the Java primitive types as well. This provides good &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@donraab/symmetric-sympathy-2c59d4541d60&quot;&gt;symmetry&lt;/a&gt; between the object and primitive containers. Here all all of the primitive types that can created using the immutable factories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ImmutableIntList list = IntLists.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.empty();&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableIntSet set = IntSets.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.empty();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;// supports all combinations of primitives&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableIntIntMap map = IntIntMaps.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.empty();  &lt;br /&gt;ImmutableIntObjectMap map = IntObjectMaps.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.empty();&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableObjectIntMap map = ObjectIntMaps.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.empty();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ImmutableIntStack stack = IntStacks.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.empty();&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableIntBag bag = IntBags.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.empty();&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Growing and Shrinking Immutable Collections&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have an immutable collection created, you may want to grow or shrink it by adding or removing elements. As I mentioned before, there are no mutating methods like add, addAll, remove or removeAll on immutable collection interfaces in Eclipse Collections. This provides what I refer to as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;contractual immutability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in addition to providing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;structural immutability&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. There are methods available that allow for safely copying and growing or shrinking immutable collections. There are methods named newWith, newWithAll, newWithout and newWithoutAll for extensions of &lt;strong&gt;ImmutableCollection&lt;/strong&gt;. For &lt;strong&gt;ImmutableMap&lt;/strong&gt; implementations, the methods are named newWithKeyValue, newWithAllKeyValues, newWithoutKey and newWithoutAllKeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ImmutableList&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; list0 = &lt;br /&gt;    Lists.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.empty();&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableList&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; list1 = &lt;br /&gt;    list0.&lt;strong&gt;newWith&lt;/strong&gt;(&quot;1&quot;);&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableList&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; list2 = &lt;br /&gt;    list1.&lt;strong&gt;newWithAll&lt;/strong&gt;(Lists.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(&quot;2&quot;));&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ImmutableSet&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; set0 = &lt;br /&gt;    Sets.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.empty();&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableSet&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; set1 = &lt;br /&gt;    set0.&lt;strong&gt;newWith&lt;/strong&gt;(&quot;1&quot;);&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableSet&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; set2 = &lt;br /&gt;    set1.&lt;strong&gt;newWithAll&lt;/strong&gt;(Sets.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(&quot;2&quot;));&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ImmutableMap&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt; map0 = &lt;br /&gt;    Maps.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.empty();&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableMap&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt; map1 = &lt;br /&gt;    map0.&lt;strong&gt;newWithKeyValue&lt;/strong&gt;(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;1&quot;);&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableMap&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt; map2 = &lt;br /&gt;    map1.&lt;strong&gt;newWithAllKeyValues&lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;br /&gt;        Lists.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(Tuples.&lt;em&gt;pair&lt;/em&gt;(&quot;2&quot;, &quot;2&quot;)))&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the interest of providing good symmetry, these methods are available on the primitive containers as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ImmutableIntList list0 =&lt;br /&gt;        IntLists.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.empty();&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableIntList list1 =&lt;br /&gt;        list0.&lt;strong&gt;newWith&lt;/strong&gt;(1);&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableIntList list2 =&lt;br /&gt;        list1.&lt;strong&gt;newWithAll&lt;/strong&gt;(IntLists.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(2));&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ImmutableIntSet set0 =&lt;br /&gt;        IntSets.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.empty();&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableIntSet set1 =&lt;br /&gt;        set0.&lt;strong&gt;newWith&lt;/strong&gt;(1);&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableIntSet set2 =&lt;br /&gt;        set1.&lt;strong&gt;newWithAll&lt;/strong&gt;(IntSets.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.with(2));&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;ImmutableIntIntMap map0 =&lt;br /&gt;        IntIntMaps.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.empty();&lt;br /&gt;ImmutableIntIntMap map1 =&lt;br /&gt;        map0.&lt;strong&gt;newWithKeyValue&lt;/strong&gt;(1, 1);&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;I discovered while writing this blog, that we were missing some symmetry in our immutable primitive map containers. We do not currently have &lt;strong&gt;newWithAllKeyValues&lt;/strong&gt; on immutable primitive maps, so I submitted an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections/issues/344&quot;&gt;issue request&lt;/a&gt; for the feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;All you need to remember to create either mutable or immutable container types in Eclipse Collections is to remember the pattern of plural factory class names to types (&lt;strong&gt;List&lt;/strong&gt; has &lt;strong&gt;Lists&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Set&lt;/strong&gt; has &lt;strong&gt;Sets&lt;/strong&gt;, etc.). Then use the code completion of your IDE to decide whether you want &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; instances. Then you can choose either &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; depending on your method naming preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections&quot;&gt;Eclipse Collections&lt;/a&gt; works with Java versions 5 though 9. So these factories can still be used today if you are working on any projects that have not yet upgraded to Java 8. If you are using a Java version before Java 8, simply use &lt;a href=&quot;http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.eclipse.collections/eclipse-collections/7.1.1&quot;&gt;Eclipse Collections 7.1.1&lt;/a&gt;. If you are using Java 8 or above, you can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.eclipse.collections/eclipse-collections/8.2.0&quot;&gt;Eclipse Collections 8.x&lt;/a&gt; or the soon to be released 9.x version. There are &lt;a href=&quot;http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.eclipse.collections/eclipse-collections/9.0.0.M3&quot;&gt;milestone releases of 9.x&lt;/a&gt; available today if you would like to experiment and provide us with feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a complete reference of all factory types and how to create collection containers, you can read this section of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse-collections/blob/master/docs/guide.md#-creating-collections-containers&quot;&gt;Eclipse Collections reference guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=8cb72ff897ee&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

	<title>PapyrusUML: My minions at MODELS 2017 conference</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://papyrusuml.wordpress.com/?p=814</guid>
	<link>https://papyrusuml.wordpress.com/2017/09/01/my-minions-at-models-2017-conference/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;As some of you may know, MODELS is &lt;strong&gt;The&lt;/strong&gt; Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems. This is where all the smart people go to talk about models&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that “models” is my middle name? Well, not really, but it is what I’m all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given my love for models, my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.polarsys.org/papyrus-ic&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;industry consortium&lt;/a&gt; has decided to be a &lt;strong&gt;GOLD&lt;/strong&gt; sponsor of the conference! Isn’t that a nice gift (both for me and &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;you&lt;/span&gt;)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, MODELS is held in Austin, Texas from Sept 20 to 22. with satellite events on Sept. 17-18. If you are going, say hi to my minions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, many of my minions will be there, attending and presenting at workshops and tutorials! If you are going, go say hi to my minions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px;&quot;&gt;Dimitris, Ernesto, Federico, Francis, Jordi, Juergen, Philip, Sebastien, and Tanja&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find them by looking at &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.polarsys.org/MODELS_2017_Conference&quot;&gt;this list&lt;/a&gt; of all the things they will be presenting at the conference!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should also ask them about the special event! (wink, wink, nudge, nudge)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My minions and I hope to see you in Austin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now go and download the latest versions of me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am extremely proud and happy that my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2017/session/mutate-and-test-your-tests&quot;&gt;talk on mutation testing&lt;/a&gt; was accepted as an early bird for EclipseCon Europe 2017. ...In this talk, I will focus on qualitative evaluation of a unit test suite. Statement coverage is commonly used to quantify the quality of a test suite: it measures the ratio of source code statements that are executed at least once when running the test suite. However, statement coverage is known to be a rather weak quality indicator.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Chris Aniszczyk: Shipping OCI v1.0.0</title>
	<guid isPermaLink="false">http://aniszczyk.org/?p=4122</guid>
	<link>http://aniszczyk.org/2017/08/29/shipping-oci-v1-0-0/</link>
	<description>&lt;p&gt;Last month after nearly 2 years, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://opencontainers.org&quot;&gt;Open Container Initiative&lt;/a&gt; (OCI) community shipped v1.0.0 (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opencontainers.org/release-notices/v1-0-0&quot;&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt;) of two container standard specifications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;[NEWS] &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/OCI_ORG&quot;&gt;@OCI_ORG&lt;/a&gt; Releases v1.0 of Container Standards: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/PzZQX9gptT&quot;&gt;https://t.co/PzZQX9gptT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/C8aIi2kZuc&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/C8aIi2kZuc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;— The Linux Foundation (@linuxfoundation) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/linuxfoundation/status/887690303838318592&quot;&gt;July 19, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of relevant container standards finalized, another thing that was enabled by this v1.0.0 release was an interesting IP Policy (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openwebfoundation.org/legal/the-owf-1-0-agreements/owfa-1-0---patent-only&quot;&gt;OWFa v1.0&lt;/a&gt;) embedded in the OCI charter. Essentially, there is patent non-assertion and royalty free patent grant made by all OCI members against the entire 1.0.0 specification implementations, not just their contributions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://twitter.com/cra/status/899668238824591361&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is simply good news for the industry when it comes to what I call establishing an “IP no fly zone” for core container technology, which should spur further container adoption. Also, standardization also helps implementors and tool builders feel safe that things won’t break, which has been a bit of a challenge given how fast container technology has been moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, one more thing to highlight is that OCI is also helping sponsor a diversity scholarship at DockerCon EU in Copenhagen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DockerCon?src=hash&quot;&gt;#DockerCon&lt;/a&gt; EU Diversity Scholarship via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/OCI_ORG&quot;&gt;@OCI_ORG&lt;/a&gt; is now open!
